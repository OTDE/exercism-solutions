# What is this?

[Exercism](exercism.io) is a website that offers free mentored help for coding problems, along with
a series of useful tests to make sure you've solved the problems correctly. In an effort to
learn functional programming paradigms and write cleaner code, I've been pluggin away at these
short practice problems for some time. This repository is here to keep track of all my solutions.
